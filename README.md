  ```````
  gulp clean
  ```````

* **Zip** _Compress you app & save in `zip` folder with timestamp for quick sharing_

  ```````
  gulp zip
  ```````

#### Angular App

* **Controller** _Creates a controller in `app/js/controllers`_

  ```````
  yo stt:controller <name>
  ```````

* **Service** _Creates a service in `app/js/services`_

  ```````
  yo stt:service <name>
  ```````

  ```````
  yo stt:directive <name>
  ```````

# Environment

Generator stt comes with development and producution modes. In default it runs in development mode.

# Bower Components
